## Planning

- Start with your database
- 2 tables minimum
- divide your tasks into 15/20 min chunks
- if a task is too abstract or takes longet then 20 mins can you divide it into smaller tasks?
- if your scope is getting out of hand check requirements
  - Start buildinf the app from the most basic version of it. WHat are the main building blocks?
- main requirements:
  - routes (static and dynamic)
  - displaying data from db
  - sending data to db
